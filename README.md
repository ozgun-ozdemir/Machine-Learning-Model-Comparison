# Machine Learning Model Comparison
This project evaluates the performance of several machine learning classification models. The evaluation is conducted on two different datasets.

## Overview
The scripts compare the performance of four different machine learning classifiers:
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)
- J48 (Decision Tree)
- MLP (Multilayer Perceptron)
  
## Datasets
- **Education Dataset:** Predicting student success or dropout based on various academic and demographic features.
- **Banking Dataset:** Predicting customer churn based on customer demographic data, account balance, and banking activities.

## Requirements
- `Python 3.x`
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
